# Factory Worker Safety Detection

## Overview
This project leverages the power of computer vision to enhance safety measures in a factory setting. Our goal is to develop a system capable of detecting whether employees are properly outfitted with their required protective equipment. 

## Features
- Real-time detection of protective equipment (helmets, safety goggles, high visibility clothing, etc.)
- Alerts management when non-compliance is detected.
- Uses computer vision to accurately identify safety equipment.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV for image and real-time video processing
- YOLO5
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Keras

You can install the prerequisites by using the following command:

```
pip install opencv-python tensorflow keras
```
